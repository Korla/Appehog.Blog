Hi!

It's me. Johannes.

I am a web developer consultant. My focus areas these years have been to build web applications which are great from a usability perspective, highly testable, and dependable, and with a scalable architecture. On this blog I will try and share my experiences with modern web development technologies. Though I live and work in Stockholm, I've found that the times that I get to spend with family and friends in the peaceful Österlen countryside is becoming more important to me, and I intend to share little snapshots of what that is like as well.

I am sure you're wondering why the company is named Appehög. It is of course due to my great-grandparents Marta and Ivar Jeppsson. They built a home for themselves and their six children in Östra Vemmerlöv, Skåne. And it is now the unofficial headquarters of *Appehög AB*.

For the past 25 years or so, it's been the place where our family gathers in the summer and during the holidays. The house was built next to a hill, *hög*, and was rumoured to have once been the home of a giant called *Appe*.

Hence, *Appehög*.
