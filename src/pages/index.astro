    <p>Hi!</p>
    <p>It's me. Johannes.</p>
    <p>
      I am a web developer consultant. My focus areas these years have been to
      build web applications which are great from a usability perspective, highly
      testable, and dependable, and with a scalable architecture. On this blog I
      will try and share my experiences with modern web development technologies.
      Though I live and work in Stockholm, I've found that the times that I get to
      spend with family and friends in the peaceful Österlen countryside is
      becoming more important to me, and I intend to share little snapshots of
      what that is like as well.

      I am sure you're wondering why the company is named Appehög. It is of course
      due to my great-grandparents Marta and Ivar Jeppsson. They built a home for
      themselves and their six children in Östra Vemmerlöv, Skåne. And it is now
      the unofficial headquarters of <i>Appehög AB</i>.

      For the past 25 years or so, it's been the place where our family gathers in
      the summer and during the holidays. The house was built next to a hill,
      <i>hög</i>, and was rumoured to have once been the home of a giant called <i>Appe</i>.

    <p>Hence, <i>Appehög</i>.</p>
